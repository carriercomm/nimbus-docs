Provisioning new resources to counteract failures or cater to increasing 
demand requires constant attention and is a repetitive task that 
can be automated. 
Nimbus Phantom monitors the health and happiness of your resources and 
automatically provisions and configures new ones based on demand.

This guide will help you configure and use Phantom.
This service dynamically scales and preserves VMs for you.
Phantom is available on 
`FutureGrid <http://www.futuregrid.org/>`_ infrastucture  allowing users to scale
VMs that are running on the many clouds of FutureGrid as well as EC2.
