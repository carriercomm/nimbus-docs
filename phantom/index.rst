Nimbus Auto-scale
================

This guide contains configuration information about the Nimbus Auto-scale
service.  This service dynamically scales and preserves VMs for users.
It currently is running and available on
`FutureGrid <http://www.futuregrid.org/>`_ allowing users to scale
VMs that are running on the many clouds of FutureGrid. 

This service is similar to the Amazon Auto-scaling Service.  However there
are some minor differences.  This service only implements a subset of 
the AWS functionality.  Details can be found here.
